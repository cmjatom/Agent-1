Shared Dependencies:

1. **HTML Structure**: All HTML files (index.html, blog.html, about.html, contact.html, posts/ai-tools.html, posts/technology.html) will share a common HTML structure, including elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.

2. **CSS Styles**: All HTML files will share the same CSS styles defined in "css/styles.css" and "css/tailwind.css". This includes classes for layout, typography, colors, etc.

3. **Tailwind CSS**: All HTML files will use Tailwind CSS for styling, which is included in "css/tailwind.css".

4. **DOM Element IDs**: Common DOM element IDs that might be used across multiple pages could include "header", "footer", "nav", "main", "content", "sidebar", etc.

5. **JavaScript Functions**: If any JavaScript is used, common functions might include functions for navigation, form validation, or handling user interaction. These would be shared across all HTML files.

6. **Data Schemas**: If any data is used, the schema would be shared across all HTML files. This could include schemas for blog posts, comments, or user profiles.

7. **Message Names**: If any messaging or notifications are used, the message names would be shared across all HTML files. This could include messages for form submission, error handling, or user notifications.
